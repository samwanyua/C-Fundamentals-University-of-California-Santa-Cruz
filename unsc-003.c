  .h is an extension that intent that means a header file,

   automatically with our program.
 So it's called pre-processor because it happens before the C code is compiled. So extra code gets added, and that code is the code that we're going to need for doing printf. 
 Without it the printf would be undeclared.*/

int main (void) /*Then we start the actual code, and that's with the keyword int which means that the function called main, and almost always, fact in our beginning course, everything will always have a main. Main will be where the program executes from, that's understood by the C system. 
 Void is another key word meaning no arguments.
 So int is a keyword meaning that the program returns an integer.
 Void is a key word that would if it's used as a data type means it's an undefined data type, or in this case it means that the argument list is empty.
