Functions - paragraph of coding by DR. P
int main(void) is a fuction
also int printf()

Why are functions important? Crucial for reuse for code or libraries ex. stdio.h
>>Fundamental for encapsulation - A function is a form of encapsulation. It allows you to structure a big piece of code.
>>A function largely should be able to do one thing well. Think of rand, think of printf, think of square root. 
Syntax:
    type funtion_name (parameter list)  //type ie int, float
        {
            // Body of the function

          declaration 
          executable statements  

        example
        void wrt_address(void)
        {
            printf("clause\n");
            printf("North Pole\n");

        }
